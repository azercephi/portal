- onUpdate does not function by itself. Needs to be used with 
  onSelectionChanged. Also doesn't work with onActivated, new version
  of deprecated onSelectionChanged.
    - appears to be known bug -- not fixed?:
       https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=154631
- For debugging purposes (or bug-to-be-fixed), refreshing pages
  chrome://history and chrome://extensions appears to restart/reload
  extension

- Google Instant may prepare/prerender some tabs beforehand and switch it
  with the current tab once user selects it. This is why exists onReplaced.
    - appears to be specificially for search pages
    - doens't appear to work for bookmarks & the sort
- Chrome user can "highlight" >1 tab with Shift key so that user can apply
  actions to all "highlighted" tabs.
- Active tabs \subseteq highlighted tabs. Exactly 1 active tab per window.

Cases to Test:
- open new tab/webpage in new tab
- close tab
- refresh tab
- navigate to another webpage in same tab
- tab replaced b/c of google instant
- open window
- close window

- User can view tab and scroll for content without actively being in Chrome, at least on Mac
